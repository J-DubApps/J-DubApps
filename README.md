### Hi there 👋

**J-DubApps/J-DubApps** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am Julian. I am also a senior Network Solution & Cloud-Architect based in Dallas, Texas USA.
In addition to design & engineering, I am also an Infrastructure PM - managing human and budgetary
resources to deploy systems projects ranging from private DMVPN clouds to Azure AD based cloud tenants.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Python, PowerShell, Cisco Viptela, MECM/SCCM, and vSphere.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Swift, Distributed Systems, and Software Defined Networking.
- 👯 I’m always looking to collaborate on fun projects.
- 💬 Ask me about Network Design, Cloud Architecture, or CI/CD DevOps.
